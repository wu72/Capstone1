# Capstone1

Welcome! This repository contains my first Capstone Project for my Springboard course. The project is focused on analyzing a user's Fitbit data, and machine learning tecniques are used to create predictive models and detect some patterns within the data.

The following materials can be found in this repository:
  1. Fitbit data extracted from Fitbit's website
  2. Heart rate data extracted using an outside source
  3. Data wrangling portion of my capstone
  4. Data story telling portion of my capstone
  5. Inferential statistics portion of my capstone
  6. Machine Learning portion of my capstone
  7. Capstone slides (PPT)
  8. Complete code of capstone
  
I am by no means an expert Python coder, so please do excuse poor coding or feel free to send comments on suggestions for code improvement!

Enjoy!
